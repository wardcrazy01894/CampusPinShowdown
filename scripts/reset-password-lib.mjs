/**
 * Logic behind `npm run account:reset-password` (scripts/reset-password.mjs):
 * the owner's way to help a friend who forgot their password. Accounts have
 * no email, so there is no self-service reset — but the owner knows every
 * player, and can set a temporary password from their own machine with their
 * own Cloudflare login. Nothing here is reachable from the game.
 *
 * The database never holds a password, only PBKDF2(server salt) of the key
 * the BROWSER derives from it (src/lib/account.ts: derivePass), so a reset
 * has to reproduce both halves. `clientKey` mirrors derivePass exactly; a
 * test pins the two together.
